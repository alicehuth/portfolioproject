<h1> HOME
        /hōm/
        Noun
        </h1>
    <h2>“Be it ever so humble, it’s more than just a place. It’s also an idea—one where the heart is.”
        </h2>
    <p>I am fascinated by the concept of “home”, and how its meaning adapts to a person’s life based on where they are and who they’re with. Home is so profoundly familiar that we, as humans, often associate it with a feeling. 

            Throughout the course of my life, I have discovered different versions of home: the place I grew up, the place I spend my summers in, and the place I now attend college in. Each home is distinguishable by the relationships I’ve built with people there, but also by the places that comprise them, that have developed sentimental value with time and experience.
